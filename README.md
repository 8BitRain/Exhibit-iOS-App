# Exhibit-iOS-App

Exhibit explores the new and exciting virtual reality
experience of viewing homes, apartments and new properties.
With a few swipes, users can navigate an intuitive search
feature and instantly find themselves standing in the room
they want to see. Inside, users can look around as if
they're actually at the property which is made possible through the
sophisticated use of gyroscopic sensors and projective geometry.
For sellers, adding listings is also a piece of cake through Parse.
From home owners to budding businesses, Exhibit aims to bring the best
places, to the best people, in the best way.
